Tips in how to run the project:

-> Backend:

    1- Clone the repository
    2- Open the project in your IDE
    3- Execute the Patagonia_DB.sql file in your MySQL Workbench to create the database
    4- Check the application.properties to configure them according to your database
    5- Run the project
    
    - To test the backend you can use Postman or any other tool to test the endpoints
    - First you need to register a admin, then login and you will get a token
    - With the admin authority you can create a new user or a new agent and then login with that user to get a new token
